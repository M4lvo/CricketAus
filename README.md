Includes python script to clean ballbyball data from domestic 1st class cricket matches provided by Cricket Australia. Cannot include the original dataset due to agreement issues. I have provided test data in the deliveries-reduced.csv file to test the script.
Includes my final dashboard made in powerBI to analyze a bowler's performance using primitive metrics and DBR metric.
